Once upon a time there was a man named Dave. Dave lived in a quiet little town and had very little
problems with his life. One day he was walking through the forest when he heard a loud noise that
would change his life forever.

That noise was a trombone. A bass trombone. A shiny, golden trombone being played by an elf. Dave, hearing this trombone, went up to this elf to ask him how he procured such a magnificent such a magnificent instrument. The elf had quite an answer for him: "I traded my ears for the instrument. My ears! Now I have a beautiful instrument and a beautiful sound, yet I can not hear it for myself because I don't have ears." Hearing this, Dave was sad.
