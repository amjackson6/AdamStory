Once upon a time there was a man named Dave. Dave lived in a quiet little town and had very little
problems with his life. One day he was walking through the forest when he heard a loud noise that
would change his life forever.

That noise was a trombone. A bass trombone. A shiny, golden trombone being played by an elf. Dave, hearing this trombone, went up to this elf to ask him how he procured such a magnificent such a magnificent instrument. The elf had quite an answer for him: "I traded my ears for the instrument. My ears! Now I have a beautiful instrument and a beautiful sound, yet I can not hear it for myself because I don't have ears." Hearing this, Dave was sad.

Dave was so sad for the elf that he decided to go on a quest: a journey to find the elf some new ears. He went to the south pole, but could not find any ears.  He went to the north pole but could not find any ears.  At last, he finally realized the one place that he could find ears for his elf friend.
